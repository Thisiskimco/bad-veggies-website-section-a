	<h1> Types of Vegetables: How to know if you are eating one </h1>
	<h4> 10/25/2059 by: Somebody </h4>

	<p> Hello, and welcome to Dhrumil's website on vegetables.  This is a fun website that was a lesson on Git changes for policymakers!!!

	<p> This is a pretend article about vegetables. Specifically how long they are and what color they are. There are lots of vegetables in the world and they are of various colors. They can be white, blue or yellow; but there are no neon vegetables in nature. That is why this article is so important to inform you about types of vegetables. Once you're done reading, you should be able to identify whether or not what you're eating is a vegetable. </p>

	<p> As you can see in the table above, my shopping list has vegetables of various colors. </p>

	<p> First, let's talk about potatoes. Your average potato is 6 inches long and 5 inches wide. Of course, there are various types of potatoes, but if you took every single potato of every size, shape and variety, they are roughly that size on average. Addionally, most potatoes are brown. Some are white and some are yellow; some are sweet and some are mellow. But potatoes are potatoes and on average they are brown. </p>

	<p> Now carrots, those are orange. But did you know that <a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/04/carrots-used-to-be-purple-before-the-17th-century/">carrots actually used to be purple? </a> Yeah, I didn't know that either, until I read the article. What an interesting fact. I didn't personally unearth that fact, but I linked to it from another website. I also don't unearth carrots; I buy them at the grocery store. Carrots are also delicious and nutritious!</p>

	<p> In conclusion, gym socks aren't vegetables, carrots used to be purple and you now know the average length of a potato. But you don't know not the distribution of potato lengths or how the length differs by potato type. I hope you can now identify whether or not what you're eating is a vegetable.</p>

	<p> If you're reading this, you've reached the end of the article and probably lost a few brain cells. Now we, a group of professional newspeople, are going to work on improving it. Kind of like a reverse mad-libs. </p>
